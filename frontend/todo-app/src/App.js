/**
 * It is possible to export multiple components from one jsx-file (module), but there is always one default.
 * The default component is always imported first. The other (not default) components should be added in curly braces after the first component.
 * If you try to import a Component that doesn't exist, it will return the default component. This does not work for components between the curly braces
 * See first import statement as example.
